# snake-game

I wanted to try something out with clojure, clojurescript, and also vert.x. I will try to change the original project to run on a server and multiple clients which can connect. A simple front-end on the server will make it possible to start/reset/resize the game as it runs.

The forked repo was based on a tutorial at http://lambdax.io/blog/posts/2016-01-19-snake-game-part-1.html.
For now very little of this is my own work/addition.

## Setup

To get an interactive development environment run:

    lein figwheel

and open your browser at [localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449/).
This will auto compile and send all changes to the browser without the
need to reload.
